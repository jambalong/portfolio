As I finish my User Experience course, I learned a lesson that no book could have taught me. I wasn't just designing a time management app; I was living on both sides of the design process simultaneously. 

In one group, I was the **Designer**, translating a user's vision into a functional interface. In another, I was the **Customer**, providing feedback on a peer's work. Juggling these two roles was challenging, but it was also the most profound learning experience I've had.

## What I Learned from Wearing Two Hats

The biggest revelation was how being a customer made me a better designer almost instantly. While acting as a customer for my peer, I struggled to articulate why a specific feature felt confusing. For instance, it was difficult to pinpoint why a set of 'Task tabs' left me unsure how to navigate. 

This gave me incredible perspective. When I switched back to being a designer and received feedback from my own customer, such as requests for persistent calendar navigation or theme customization, I didn't just hear a list of changes. I understood the **feeling** behind the request. I realized that feedback isn't a critique; it's a necessary perspective.

> The best designers aren't just the ones with the best technical skills; they're the ones with the deepest empathy.

## Strengths and Areas for Growth

I believe I succeeded as a Designer by fostering a collaborative conversation. While I await my customer's reaction to the final footer and page designs, I am confident that this user-centered approach resulted in a functional, navigable app. 

The biggest challenge was the mental switch. In one hour, I'd be focused on component logic and flow; in the next, I'd have to focus entirely on my gut feelings as a user, ignoring the technical "how." 

If I were to do it again, I would be even more intentional about documenting my experience as a customer. I might keep a journal of my frustrations and "aha!" moments to better guide my own design process. Nothing builds empathy quite like being in your customer's shoes.
